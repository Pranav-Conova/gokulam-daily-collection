## Tips for Best Results

2. **Proper Orientation**: Keep images straight and readable
3. **Good Contrast**: Ensure text is clearly visible
4. **Complete Data**: Include all relevant sections of the report

## Troubleshooting

### API Key Issues
- Ensure your API key is correctly set in `.env.local`
- Restart the development server after changing environment variables
- Check that your API key has proper permissions

### Image Processing Fails
- Try a different image format (PNG works best)
- Ensure the image contains tabular financial data
- Check image quality and lighting

### Branch Not Auto-Selected
- The AI will try to match branch names automatically
- If no match is found, manually select from dropdown
- The system uses fuzzy matching for partial names

### Data Extraction Issues
- The AI extracts visible numerical data from images
- Edit any incorrect values in the modal before applying
- Some fields may be empty if not clearly visible in the image

## API Usage and Costs
- Gemini Vision API is free tier with usage limits
- Each image upload counts as one API call
- Monitor your usage in Google AI Studio

## Security Notes
- API keys are stored locally in environment variables
- Never commit API keys to version control
- Keep your `.env.local` file private
